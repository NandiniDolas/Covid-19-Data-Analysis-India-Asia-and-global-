The COVID-19 Data Analysis Project aims to explore and visualize the global effects of the pandemic using a complete data analytics workflow — from raw data cleaning to final visualization.

The process starts with Excel for handling missing values and formatting data, continues with SQL for running analytical queries, and concludes with Tableau for creating interactive dashboards that showcase trends in confirmed cases, recoveries, deaths, and vaccinations.

Objectives:

Clean and preprocess COVID-19 datasets in Excel

Write SQL queries to extract and analyze insights

Build interactive dashboards and maps in Tableau

Identify country-wise growth rates and vaccine progress

Dashboard Insights:

Global summary cards (Total Cases, Deaths, Recoveries, Vaccinations)

Daily and cumulative trend analysis

Country and continent comparison

Vaccination vs Case Growth visuals

Dynamic filters and user-interactive view

Tools & Technologies:

Excel – Data cleaning, filtering, and preprocessing

SQL – Data querying, aggregation, and analysis

Tableau – Data visualization and dashboard creation
